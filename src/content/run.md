## Welcome to the Catface Running Club!

The Catface running club is a club for the joy of running, whether it's fast or slow, up a mountain or on a treadmill.

Anyone is free to compete for catface in their local races - just enter "cat face nospace" as your team in the form! 

Here's a sketch of a team shirt design if anyone would like one:
