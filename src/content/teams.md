# Championship Teams

The CAT Rally Championship features several competitive teams, each with their unique identity, driving philosophy, and community. Teams compete not only for individual glory but also for the coveted Team Championship title.

## Team Championship Format

Teams consist of multiple drivers who compete in events throughout the season. For each event, only the top 3 drivers from each team score points towards the Team Championship, creating strategic depth and encouraging team coordination.

## How to Join a Team

Interested in joining a team? Each team has their own recruitment process and requirements. Generally, teams look for:

- Consistent event participation
- Good sportsmanship and community involvement
- Driving skill that complements the team's existing strengths
- Commitment to team goals and championship campaign

Contact team representatives through our Discord server to learn about current opportunities.

## Independent Drivers

Not every driver belongs to a team, and that's perfectly fine! Independent drivers compete for individual glory and contribute to the championship's diversity. Some of our most memorable moments have come from independent drivers challenging the established teams.
