# Championship Teams

The CAT Rally Championship features several competitive teams, each with their unique identity, driving philosophy, and community. Teams compete not only for individual glory but also for the coveted Team Championship title.

## Team Championship Format

Teams consist of multiple drivers who compete in events throughout the season. For each event, only the top 3 drivers from each team score points towards the Team Championship, creating strategic depth and encouraging team coordination.
