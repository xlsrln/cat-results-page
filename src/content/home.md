For CAT, all you need to participate is the **art of rally** game, your favourite screen recording software and somewhere to upload your videos. Under the pages for rules and stages you can find more information.
The championship is meant to be fun and easy to participate in. It relies on a combination of trust and peer review. If you make an error or spot something suspicious, please get in touch, and don't panic! If you have any feedback don't hesitate to reach out! (picture by [nap](https://twitter.com/napfirm))
